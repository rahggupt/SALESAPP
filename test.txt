### Testing Sample Medicines

1. First, ensure your backend server is running:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm run dev
   ```

2. In a new terminal, seed the database with sample medicines:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm run seed:medicines
   ```
   This will:
   - Clear any existing medicines
   - Add 6 sample medicines with different:
     - Categories (pain-relief, antibiotics, vitamins, prescription, over-the-counter)
     - Storage requirements (cold, extreme_cold, hot, extreme_hot)
     - Price units (strip, box, bottle, vial)
     - Prescription requirements
     - Stock levels and expiry dates

3. Test the following features with the sample data:
   - View all medicines in the inventory
   - Search medicines by name, description, or composition
   - Filter medicines by category
   - Sort medicines by different fields
   - Archive some medicines
   - View archived medicines
   - Check storage requirements display
   - Verify price units display

4. After testing, you can clean up the sample data:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm run delete:medicines
   ```
   This will remove all medicines from the database.

Note: The sample medicines include a variety of real-world scenarios to help test all features of the application.
